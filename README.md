# DataStructure
Students are asked to implement an O.O. C++ program to simulate the process of Final Degree Projects to students of Computer Science.
To do so, the program will read CSV files with the following data:
1.	List of available projects. With number (int), name (max. 50 chars) and project description (max. 200 chars).
2.	List of students waiting for assignment. With id (name and surname, like in UAH mail without @) (max. 50 chars), average mark in all degree courses, and list of requested projects (up to 10) by number.
